# harness-natural-radiowave-magnetosphere-for-energy
similar to exciting electrons in a photovoltaic plate with photons instead using the natural momentum of earth's natural radiowaves and magnetosphere

being able to harness the natural radiowaves to dry microscopic fritcon to charge electrons to create electrial output (similar to photons naturally exciting metalic substances in a photovoltaic plate to create electricity)

the natural momentum and movement of radiowaves and or the earth's natural magnetosphere (think of an analog compass always spinning a needle to face north on a micro scale ....an array of micro scale analog compasses that can reset through electrical magnetic disturbance to drive more energy from natural momentum) passing through an ultra thin layer of semi-liquid metalic (magnetically charged) liquid with an exit anode and exit cathode in order to create "microscopic" friction to drive electrial energy output to power devices from handheld electronic devices to more mid range electric devices






* side thought
(possibly or possibly not increasing output using a "step-up" transformer)
possibly using a step-up transformer even the size of a dime to drive 1 volt up to 12 volt a step-up transformer the size of a physical (9 volt battery) with many turns in the transformer to drive 1 volt up to 60 volts~
